00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,186
英语语法之-定语从句第一部分

2
00:00:05,186 --> 00:00:10,400
在英文中 被定语从句所修饰的对象叫作antecedent

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:18,120
英文中对这个词的解释是a word phrase clause or sentence to which a pronoun refers

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:28,400
即表示“代词所指代的词、短语、从句或句子” 所以先行词可以是一个词、短语、分句或者独立的句子等

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,720
形容词作定语与从句作定语比较

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,746
当要表达复杂的意思时 往往需要借助于定语从句来完成

7
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:41,293
即要用定语从句来修饰某个名词或名词短语

8
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:48,680
比如当我们说“我不喜欢懒人” 这时只需要用一个形容词lazy来作定语就可以

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,227
I don t like lazy people.

10
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:57,441
如果要表达稍微复杂一点的意思 比如说“我不喜欢不守信用的人” 这时

11
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:01,028
简单地用形容词作定语就无能为力了

12
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:07,574
就要借助于一个句子来修饰名词 用作名词的定语 对名词进行限制

13
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:11,521
I don t like people who never keep their word.

14
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:16,028
定语从句的两个重要概念：先行词和关系词

15
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:20,082
被定语从句所修饰的对象称为先行词

16
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:29,602
重复指代先行词、起连接主句和从句的作用 并且在定语从句中充当一定成分的连接词称为关系词

17
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:31,708
关系词有两个作用：

18
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:38,002
代词的作用： 重复指代先行词并且在定语从句中充当一定成分

19
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:41,282
连接作用：即连接主句和从句

20
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:43,455
先行词的结构特点

21
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:49,668
先行词是一个词 可以是一个单词 通常是名词 也可以是代词

22
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:58,149
主要包括：人称代词he（其他人称代词不可以） 指示代词that/those 不定代词one等

23
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:05,402
比如例句：幸福与智慧的区别在于：认为自己最幸福的人 他真的就是最幸福

24
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:09,629
而认为自己最智慧的人 却往往是最大的傻瓜

25
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,309
There is this difference between happiness and

26
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:24,896
wisdom: he who thinks himself the happiest man really is so but he who thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool.

27
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:26,710
再重复读一遍：

28
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:35,150
There is this difference between happiness and wisdom: he who thinks himself the happiest man really is so

29
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:41,524
but he who thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool.

30
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:45,844
这里的两个定语从句的先行词都是代词he

31
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:50,991
注意：这里的he不是具体指某个人 而是表示泛指

32
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:55,591
一般来讲 人称代词后面是不能接定语从句的

33
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:02,032
比如我们不能说“We who think ourselves...” 或“You who think yourself...

34
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:09,258
等等 因为人称代词已经表达了一个完整的意思 不需要任何定语从句来修饰

35
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:15,245
但人称代词若是表示泛指 则可以接定语从句来进行修饰

36
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:19,365
只有那些有耐心将简单的事情做得完美的人

37
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,699
才能学会轻松地做好难事的技能

38
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:30,179
Only those who have the patience to do simple things perfectly will acquire the skill to do

39
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,753
difficult things easily.

40
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:42,393
Only those who have the patience to do simple things perfectly will acquire the skill to do difficult things easily.

41
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:51,927
这里的those指人 作先行词 被定语从句who have the patience to do simple things perfectly所修饰

42
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:54,088
先行词是一个短语

43
00:03:54,088 --> 00:04:03,741
In Europe as elsewhere multi-media groups have been increasingly successful groups which bring together television

44
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:09,702
radio newspapers magazines and publishing houses that work in

45
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:12,235
relation to one another.

46
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:17,448
在欧洲 像在其他地方一样 多媒体集团越来越成功了

47
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:25,609
这些集团把相互间联系密切的电视台、电台、报纸、杂志以及出版社组合到了一起

48
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:28,369
In Europe as elsewhere

49
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:35,822
multi-media groups have been increasingly successful groups which bring together television

50
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:38,395
radio newspapers

51
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:44,076
magazines and publishing houses that work in relation to one another.

52
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:54,262
这里的关系词which指代的先行词是successful groups这个名词短语 关系词that指代的先行词是television

53
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:56,836
radio newspapers

54
00:04:56,836 --> 00:05:00,942
magazines and publishing houses这个名词短语

55
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:03,156
先行词是一个分句

56
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:05,822
He said that he had no time

57
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:07,769
which isn't true.

58
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:11,169
他说他没有时间 事实并非如此

59
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:16,609
这里which指代的是一个宾语从句that he had no time

60
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,303
先行词是一个完整的句子

61
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:25,530
My girlfriend likes dancing with other guys which really drives me crazy.

62
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,023
我女友喜欢和别的小伙子跳舞 这让我十分恼火

63
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:35,916
先行词是my girlfriend likes dancing with other guys这一完整的句子

64
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:38,063
先行词的位置特点

65
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:42,157
先行词 加 其他定语 加 定语从句

66
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:44,157
这种情形最常见

67
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:51,250
这是由于先行词同时带有多个定语 定语从句与其他定语相比 一般较长

68
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,103
结构也较复杂

69
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,157
因此

70
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:58,597
按照英语的“尾重原则（principle of end weight）”

71
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:04,903
结构复杂的定语从句置于其他定语后边 从而造成与先行词隔离

72
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:09,370
The mineral elements from the soil that are usable

73
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:16,811
by the plant must be dissolved in the soil solution before they can be taken into the root.

74
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:24,344
土壤中可供植物利用的矿物质只有先溶解在土壤中 然后才能被植物的根部吸收

75
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:28,185
先行词 加 状语 加 定语从句

76
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:32,358
造成先行词与关系词被分隔的第二种情形

77
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:40,199
就是在先行词与关系词之间插入一个状语 这个状语一般是修饰主句的谓语动词的

78
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,012
Never leave that until tomorrow which you can do today.

79
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:50,079
这里的先行词是that 定语从句是which you can do today

80
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:59,092
现在二者之间插入了一个时间状语until tomorrow来修饰leave 从而造成先行词与关系词被分隔

81
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:04,293
今日事 今日毕（不要把今天能做的事情留到明天做）

82
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:08,213
If there is anything in the world that a young man

83
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:18,533
should be more grateful for than another it is the poverty which necessitates starting life under very great disadvantage.

84
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:23,253
这里的关系代词that在从句中作介词for的宾语

85
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:30,079
对于青年人来说 如果世上真的有什么事物是他最应该感激的 那就是贫穷

86
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,960
因为贫穷能促使他在非常恶劣的环境下开创生活

87
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,920
作主语的先行词 加 谓语部分 加 定语从句

88
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,013
先行词与关系词被分隔的第三种情形就是两者被主句谓语隔开

89
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:56,600
这是因为先行词在主句中作主语 然后它又被一个定语从句所修饰 而定语从句一般都会比主句谓语的结构复杂

90
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:01,761
因此 按照英语的“尾重原则（principle of end weight）”

91
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:08,987
结构复杂的定语从句置于主句谓语后边 从而造成关系词与先行词被隔离

92
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:12,041
It can be predicted however

93
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:20,054
that from time to time questions will arise which will require specific scientific answers.

94
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:28,255
然而 可以预见的是 将来会经常出现一些问题 这些问题需要给出专门的科学的回答

95
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:31,121
定语从句中的主谓一致问题

96
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:39,361
定语从句的谓语动词是用单数还是用复数 这不取决于关系词 而是由先行词决定的

97
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:48,802
Despite much research there are still certain elements in the life cycle of the insect that is not fully understood.

98
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:50,748
is 应改为are

99
00:08:50,749 --> 00:09:00,535
这里先行词elements与关系词that被分隔 因为elements还有一个后置定语in the life cycle of the insect

100
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:06,029
显然 这种分隔属于：先行词+其他定语+定语从句

101
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:13,416
that指代elements 在从句中作主语 所以 谓语动词要用复数形式的are

102
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:16,750
关系词在定语从句中充当的成分

103
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,243
关系词用作从句的主语

104
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:21,750
比较简单句和定语从句

105
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:25,591
看看一个简单句如何变成定语从句

106
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:30,471
The woman is a famous dancer and she lives next door.

107
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:37,857
这个句中有一个“重复元素” 这里的she指代 the woman 即两句之间有一个交叉点

108
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:42,084
而通过这个交叉点建立起两句之间的联系

109
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:46,924
现在要用she lives next door来作定语修饰the woman

110
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:50,058
以告诉对方哪位女士是舞蹈演员

111
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:54,191
而在定语从句中 指代“人”的关系词要用who

112
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:55,231
因此

113
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:57,218
上句可改写成：

114
00:09:57,218 --> 00:10:03,205
The woman is a famous dancer who (=and she) lives next door.

115
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:12,926
这里的关系词who既取代了代词she也取代了连词and 即who既具有代词的作用也起着连接的作用

116
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:18,099
另外 定语从句一般要紧跟在它所修饰的名词后面

117
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:21,686
因此 上一句又可进一步改写成：

118
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:25,046
The woman who lives next door is a

119
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:26,899
famous dancer.

120
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:34,552
由此看到 关系词who既指代the woman 同时又在从句中作主语 而且还替换了and

121
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,392
起着连词的作用

122
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:41,659
这位女士是一名著名的舞蹈演员 她就住在我家隔壁

123
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,420
在变换过程中要注意三点：

124
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:52,926
用关系词who代替人称代词（如she或they）后 定语从句里就不能再保留这些代词了

125
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:54,593
比如不能说：

126
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:59,340
The woman who she lives next door is a famous dancer.

127
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,380
I like guys who they have a good sense of humor.

128
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:08,727
事实上 定语从句可以修饰一个主句当中的任何一个名词

129
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:18,261
但是 我们关注的往往是关系词在定语从句中所充当的成分 不关心定语从句是修饰主句的哪个名词

130
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:26,888
定语从句的谓语动词形式是由关系词所指代的先行词来决定的 而不是取决于关系词本身

131
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:35,649
定语从句who lives next door中的who指代的woman是单数名词 故谓语用单数的lives

132
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,809
而定语从句who have a good sense of

133
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:44,715
humor中的who指代的guys是复数名词 故谓语用复数的have

134
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:49,129
Anger is a thief who steals away the nice moments.

135
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:53,542
愤怒就如同一个窃贼 盗取了我们的幸福时光

136
00:11:53,542 --> 00:12:00,049
He who is not handsome at twenty nor strong at thirty nor rich at forty

137
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:06,675
nor wise at fifty will never be handsome strong rich or wise.

138
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:14,049
一个人若在20岁时不俊美、30岁时不健康、40岁时不富有、50岁时不明智

139
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,929
那么他将永远不会拥有这些

140
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,543
There is this difference between happiness and wisdom:

141
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:26,716
the person who thinks himself the happiest man really is so

142
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:33,650
but the person who thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool.

143
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:39,811
幸福与智慧区别于此：认为自己是最幸福的 他真的就是最幸福的

144
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:44,451
而认为自己是最有智慧的 他却往往是最大的傻瓜

145
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:49,997
The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.

146
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:56,171
世界犹如一本书 而那些从不出门旅行的人仅仅读了这本书的一页

147
00:12:56,171 --> 00:13:01,224
Of course I am not talking about easy-come-easy-go

148
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:02,665
friendship.

149
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:11,491
I m talking about friends who care deeply about each other who support each other who make life worth living.

150
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:21,225
当然了 我这里所说的友谊不是那种“来得快去得也快”的泛泛之交 而是那种彼此之间能真正互相关心的朋友

151
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:26,332
能够互相支持的朋友 能够让你的人生更有意义的朋友

152
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,453
关系词用作从句中动词的宾语

153
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:35,253
关系词除了在定语从句中作主语外 还可以在从句中作宾语

154
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:41,026
而且 还可以进一步区分为从句动词的宾语和从句介词的宾语

155
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:45,679
例句1) I'd really like to find a friend and I can

156
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,026
trust him completely.

157
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:54,626
例句2) I'd really like to find a friend I can trust who completely.

158
00:13:54,627 --> 00:14:02,213
在例句1）中 这里的him指代名词短语a friend 可以用关系词who来替代him

159
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:04,587
充当动词trust的宾语

160
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:09,173
又因为who有连词的作用 所以此时and就要去掉了

161
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:11,173
如例句2）所示

162
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:17,640
另一方面 关系词who要置于从句的开头 所以要把who移到I的前面

163
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:20,654
原句从而变成了下面的例句3）：

164
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:24,227
3）I d really like to find a friend

165
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:27,281
who I can trust completely.

166
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:31,054
我想找一个我完全能够信任的人做朋友

167
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:35,254
He is the best grammar teacher who I have ever

168
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:36,268
seen.

169
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:39,361
他是我见过的最好的语法老师

170
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,841
It s hard to have a friend who you can trust

171
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:44,508
completely.

172
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,695
很难有一个你能完全信任的朋友

173
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:50,815
关系词用作从句中介词的宾语

174
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:54,215
例句1) I'm talking about friends and

175
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:57,909
you can share almost everything with them.

176
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:02,429
例句2) I'm talking about friends who you can share

177
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,803
almost everything with.

178
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,230
这里的who充当介词with的宾语

179
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,883
我这里说的朋友 是指那些你几乎可以把一切与之分享的人

180
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:19,924
I hope I never have a boss who I can t talk to about my problems.

181
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:23,190
这里的who充当介词to的宾语

182
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:27,551
我不希望有一个无法与其谈论我的问题的老板

183
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:34,484
I d prefer someone who I have something in common with — who I can talk to easily.

184
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:39,365
这里的关系词who分别充当介词with和to的宾语

185
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:43,631
我喜欢那些与我有共同点的人 这样易交流

186
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,298
作宾语的关系词可以省去

187
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:51,538
不论关系词是作动词的宾语还是作介词的宾语都可以省去

188
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:56,045
比如以上讨论过的相关例句 可以分别改写成：

189
00:15:56,045 --> 00:16:02,579
I d really like to find a friend (关系词省略) I can trust completely.

190
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:09,845
I hope I never have a boss (关系词省略) I can t talk to about my problems.

191
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:13,405
在从句中作主语的关系词无法省去

192
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,339
比如不能这样说：

193
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:20,539
I like guys (关系词不能省略) have a good sense of humor.

194
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,860
关系代词与先行词的搭配关系

195
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,500
先行词指“人”

196
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,966
用关系代词who或whom

197
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:29,940
who和whom的区别

198
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,260
who的前面不能与介词搭配使用

199
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,940
因为who是主格

200
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:41,700
形式 所以在介词的后面不能用who 比如不说with who 而说with whom

201
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,953
I m talking about friends who you can share almost

202
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,714
everything with.

203
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:53,540
不能说“I m talking about friends with who you can share almost everything.”

204
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:59,821
而应该说“I m talking about friends with whom you can share almost everything.”

205
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:07,221
主格形式的who除了作定语从句的主语外 还可以充当定语从句的宾语或表语

206
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,367
whom在定语从句中不能作主语

207
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:12,648
但可作宾语或表语

208
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:19,021
A rich person is not one who has the most but is one who needs the least.

209
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:24,462
一个富有的人 不是因为他拥有的最多 而是因为他需要的最少

210
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:29,995
这里的who作从句的主语 所以不能用whom 不说whom has…

211
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:34,128
Only the people who have the patience to do simple

212
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:40,262
things perfectly will acquire the skill to do difficult things easily.

213
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:46,449
只有有耐心圆满完成简单工作的人 才能够轻而易举地完成困难的事

214
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,903
这里的who作从句的主语 所以不能用whom 不说whom have…

215
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:59,450
总之 who可以作主语 也可以代替whom作宾语或表语 但不能用在介词后面

216
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:03,557
而因为whom是宾格形式 所以不能作主语

217
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:06,904
表示人或物的所有关系 用whose

218
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:12,438
whose表示所有关系 其作用就如同物主代词my your

219
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:17,224
her his their和our whose的后面要接名词

220
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:19,558
whose可指人也可指物

221
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:26,651
“whose+名词”在从句中可作主语、动词的宾语或介词的宾语 whose同that一样

222
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,251
既可以指人 也可以指物

223
00:18:29,252 --> 00:18:30,932
I know a friend.

224
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:34,038
His brother is a pop singer.

225
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,212
I know a friend whose bropther is a pop singer.

226
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:42,145
我认识一个朋友 他哥哥是一名流行歌手

227
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:48,519
例句2）里的whose代替了例句1）里的his 指friend 即表示人

228
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,159
When I looked through the window

229
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,160
I saw a girl whose beauty took my breath away.

230
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,933
当我朝窗外看去 猛然看见一个美女 其美貌让我惊讶不已

231
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:05,974
这里的whose beauty作从句的主语 whose指人即a girl

232
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:09,947
It was a meeting whose importance I did not

233
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,294
realize at the time.

234
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:16,054
这个会议的重要性当时我并没有意识到

235
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,534
这里的whose importance作从句动词realize的宾语

236
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,828
whose指物即a meeting

237
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,321
先行词指“物” 用关系代词which

238
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:29,028
We are studying sentences.

239
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:31,961
They contain adjective clauses.

240
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:37,695
We are studying sentences which contain adjective clauses.

241
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:41,202
我们正在学习带有定语从句的句子

242
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:46,055
这里的先行词是sentences 表示“物” 因此不能用who

243
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:53,096
要用which代替they 指代sentences 告诉对方“我们正在学习什么类型的句子”

244
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:59,309
关系词which所指代的先行词比较复杂 它除了可以指单个的名词外

245
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,296
还可以指代短语甚至是从句

246
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:04,736
先行词是单个的名词

247
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:09,362
Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.

248
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:12,189
愤怒是吹灭心灵之灯的风

249
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,256
先行词是wind 即which指单个的名词

250
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:24,323
Perhaps it is human to appreciate little that which we have and to long for that which we have

251
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,257
not.

252
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,337
先行词是that 即which指单个的名词

253
00:20:29,337 --> 00:20:34,324
或许 “不惜已获 贪求不得”是人类共同的弱点吧

254
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:36,484
先行词是一个短语

255
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:39,004
which可以指代一个短语

256
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:43,884
He likes climbing mountains which is a good exercise.

257
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:48,604
先行词是主句中的一个动名词短语climbing mountains

258
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:52,190
他喜欢爬山 这是一项很好的运动

259
00:20:52,191 --> 00:20:54,351
先行词是一个句子

260
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:57,684
which可以指代前面的整个句子

261
00:20:57,684 --> 00:21:01,897
He tore up my photo which upset me.

262
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:05,551
他把我的照片给撕了 这让我很生气

263
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:10,204
全句“he tore up my photo”作which的先行词

264
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:12,058
that可以指代“人”

265
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:13,711
也可以指代“物”

266
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:18,124
关系代词that的意义和用法主要有以下三点：

267
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:20,484
that既可指“人”也可指“物”

268
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:24,778
指“物”时可以替换which 指“人”时可以替换who

269
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:28,178
that不用在非限制性定语从句中

270
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:31,819
that不能用于介词的后面（同who一样）

271
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:38,192
Too many people spend money which they haven t earned to buy things which they don t want

272
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:41,646
to impress people who they don t like.

273
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:48,353
太多的人花他们还没挣到的钱 买他们不想要的东西 取悦他们不喜欢的人

274
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:53,633
可以用that替换其中的which和who而将这句话改写成

275
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:57,633
“Too many people spend money that they haven t earned

276
00:21:57,633 --> 00:22:03,206
to buy things that they don t want to impress people that they don t like.

277
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:08,807
这里that的先行词有“物（money和things）” 也有“人（people）”

278
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,367
作宾语的关系词可以省去

279
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,887
因此这句话也可说成

280
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:21,607
“Too many people spend money (省略) they haven t earned to buy things (省略) they don t want

281
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:25,567
to impress people (省略) they don t like.”

282
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:29,113
that与which和who在用法上的区别：

283
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:32,153
- 先行词中同时出现“人”和“物”时

284
00:22:32,154 --> 00:22:39,420
用that The writer and his novels that the article deals with are quite familiar to us.

285
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:45,021
这篇文章里所说的这个作家以及他的小说 我们都比较熟悉

286
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:48,767
这里的先行词是the writer and his novels

287
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:55,808
即同时有“人（writer）”和“物（his novels）” 所以要选用that引导定语从句

288
00:22:55,808 --> 00:23:02,648
先行词为指“物”的all little few much none和the first时 用that

289
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,608
All that glitters is not gold.

290
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:08,074
闪光的并非都是金子

291
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:12,835
这里的先行词是all 所以用that来引导定语从句

292
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:19,941
另外要注意的是 这里有一个半否定的问题：all什么什么not要译成“并非都是”

293
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:22,928
不能译成全否定的“所有都不”

294
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:26,408
The book contains little that is useful.

295
00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:29,502
这本书里几乎没有有用的东西

296
00:23:29,502 --> 00:23:37,742
这里的先行词是表示否定意义的代词little（几乎没有什么） 所以用that来引导定语从句

297
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:40,888
There is not much that can be done.

298
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,048
这没有什么可以做的了

299
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:48,342
这里的先行词是代词much 所以用that来引导定语从句

300
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:55,342
As long as you stand up to the difficulties there are none that cannot be overcome.

301
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:59,795
只要你勇敢地去面对困难 就没有什么克服不了的

302
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:05,062
这里的先行词是代词none 所以用that来引导定语从句

303
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:10,888
先行词是不定代词something anything nothing和everything时

304
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:12,515
一般用that

305
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:19,235
先行词被any only all every no some much few

306
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:23,062
little 序数词 形容词的最高级

307
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:29,249
the only the one the very the right和the last等成分修饰时

308
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,730
用that Tell us all things that you know.

309
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,370
把你知道的都告诉我们

310
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,796
The very problem that I want to solve is like this.

311
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:42,663
我想解决的问题就像这个一样

312
00:24:42,663 --> 00:24:46,970
He is the only man that can speak four foreign

313
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:49,851
languages in our company.

314
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:53,717
他是我们公司唯一一个会说四种外语的人

315
00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:56,971
that不用在非限制性定语从句中

316
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:59,517
I became a single mother

317
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:04,891
overnight which is nothing like becoming famous overnight.

318
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:10,038
我在一夜之间成了单亲妈妈 这跟一夜成名可完全不同

319
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:17,651
不能说“I became a single mother overnight that is nothing like becoming famous overnight.”

320
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:20,132
that不能用于介词后面

321
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:27,145
The world in which we live is made up of matter. 我们所生活的世界是由物质组成的

322
00:25:27,146 --> 00:25:31,706
或：The world which we live in is made up of matter.

323
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:36,186
或：The world that we live in is made up of matter.

324
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:41,039
但不能说“The world in that we live is made up of matter.”

325
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,639
介词 加 关系代词

326
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:45,426
看从句选介词

327
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:51,119
所用介词须与定语从句中的动词构成固定搭配（最常见）

328
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,066
这里所说的动词往往是指定语从句中的谓语动词

329
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:59,719
The girl with whom you work is his girlfriend.

330
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:03,199
和你一起工作的女孩是他的女朋友

331
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:11,240
关系词whom前面的介词with与定语从句中的谓语动词work构成固定搭配work with

332
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,586
表示“和……一起工作”

333
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:17,613

334
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:20,427
他是我认为你可以信赖的人

335
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:28,253
关系词whom前面的介词on与定语从句中的谓语动词depend构成固定搭配depend on

336
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,760
表示“依靠”

337
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,667
看从句的形容词：

338
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:37,293
所用介词须与定语从句中的形容词构成搭配（比较常见）

339
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:41,147
如果定语从句的谓语不是一个实义动词

340
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:48,360
而是由be动词与某个形容词构成的 我们则要使用与该形容词搭配的介词

341
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,293
He referred me to some reference books with which

342
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:54,987
I am not very familiar.

343
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:58,760
他让我参考的几本书我一本也不熟悉

344
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:07,441
关系词which前面的介词with与定语从句谓语部分中的 形容词familiar构成固定搭配be

345
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:11,494
familiar with sth. 表示“对……熟悉”

346
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:18,707
They will pass along their fresh impressions to the youth groups in which they are active.

347
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:24,614
他们会把自己获得的新鲜印象与他们积极参与的青年团体分享

348
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:34,828
关系词which前面的介词in与定语从句谓语部分中的形容词active构成固定搭配be active in sth.

349
00:27:34,828 --> 00:27:36,708
表示“积极参与”

350
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:43,615
看从句的名词：所用介词须与定语从句中的某个名词构成搭配（较少用）

351
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:47,882
Many hypersomniacs suffer from narcolepsy

352
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:52,269
for which the primary symptom is excessive daytime

353
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,976
sleepiness.

354
00:27:53,976 --> 00:28:01,416
许多嗜睡的人都患有发作性嗜睡病 其早期症状就是在白天都极度想睡觉

355
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:10,097
这里的关系词which前面的介词for与定语从句中的名词symptom构成固定搭配symptom for

356
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:12,203
表示“是……症状”

357
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:14,457
看先行词选介词

358
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:21,097
The ease with which Mr. Zhang cracked the complex sentence was unbelievable.

359
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:28,098
这个复杂的句子 张老师能够如此轻而易举地分析出来 真是让人难以置信

360
00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:29,991
拆分句子如下：

361
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:36,684
Mr. Zhang cracked the complex sentence with ease and the ease was unbelievable.

362
00:28:36,684 --> 00:28:40,391
把the ease was unbelievable作为主句

363
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:47,952
将Mr.Zhang cracked the complex sentence with ease作为定语从句来修饰the ease

364
00:28:47,952 --> 00:28:50,578
将这两句合并起来就是：

365
00:28:50,578 --> 00:28:57,752
The ease （Mr. Zhang cracked the complex sentence with ease） was unbelievable.

366
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:04,005
先行词是ease 所以我们用关系词which来指代 再将上句改写成：

367
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:07,512
The ease （Mr. Zhang cracked the complex

368
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:11,058
sentence with which） was unbelievable.

369
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:14,538
关系词which应该放在从句的开头

370
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:23,352
又因为with which（就相当于 with ease）是一个固定搭配 所以要将with which一同移到句子开头

371
00:29:23,353 --> 00:29:26,113
于是上句就进一步改写成：

372
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:33,153
The ease （with which Mr. Zhang cracked the complex sentence） was unbelievable.

373
00:29:33,153 --> 00:29:40,166
常见的有：with ease at the rate in the direction to the extent to the degree

374
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:45,073
at the temperature by the means by the mode in a culture

375
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:47,113
in practice等等

376
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:51,273
at the speed和at the rate 表示“以这种速度”

377
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:55,366
The speed at which an animal lives is determined

378
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:59,820
by measuring the rate at which it uses oxygen.

379
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,500
通过测定动物消耗氧气的速率可以测定该动物的生长速度

380
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:09,114
to the extent 表示“在某种程度上”

381
00:30:09,114 --> 00:30:16,674
When television was first introduced the extent to which it would affect human society

382
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:19,101
could not have been foreseen.

383
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:25,621
人们发明电视的时候 并没能预见到它会对人类社会产生多大的影响

384
00:30:25,622 --> 00:30:28,955
by the means 表示“通过这种方式”

385
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:36,582
Public marches are an effective means by which the people can bring social inequalities to the

386
00:30:36,582 --> 00:30:39,835
attention of government officials.

387
00:30:39,835 --> 00:30:46,742
by which就等于说by the means 表示“通过这种方式” 在定语从句中作状语

388
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:48,728
修饰从句的谓语

389
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:56,555
公众通过游行示威这种方式 可以有效地让政府官员们注意到不平等的社会现实

390
00:30:56,556 --> 00:31:01,409
表示所属关系或部分与整体的关系时用介词of

391
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:07,396
The company of which Max Harrison was until recently the chairman

392
00:31:07,396 --> 00:31:11,142
has made loss of three million pounds this year.

393
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:14,822
这里的of which相当于of the company

394
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:23,089
于是整个定语从句相当于Max Harrison was until recently the chairman of the company

395
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,103
所以这里的of表示所属关系

396
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:29,489
即the chairman是属于这个公司的

397
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:36,556
原定语从句可以改写为：the chairman of which was Max Harrison until recently

398
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:43,850
这家公司今年亏损达三百万英镑 直到前不久Max Harrison还是它的董事长

399
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:51,371
该句型的结构往往是“不定代词/数量词/形容词的比较级或最高级+of which/whom”

400
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:54,211
用来表示数量或某种特点

401
00:31:54,211 --> 00:32:01,904
具体来讲 在介词of前面常出现的词包括：all each both either neither

402
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:07,597
none little few many much some most any

403
00:32:07,598 --> 00:32:15,771
the majority half several a number half none以及数字和形容词的最高级等等

404
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:21,585
值得注意的是 这里of前面的成分都可以后移至定语从句中

405
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:23,626
固定的介宾结构

406
00:32:23,626 --> 00:32:28,786
关系代词前面的介词有时与固定的介宾短语结构有关

407
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:33,732
比如in this case in one's honor和with one's help等

408
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:38,932
它们若出现在定语从句中 则会相应地变成in which case

409
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,733
in whose honor和with whose help

410
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:46,226
He may be late in which case we should wait for him.

411
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:50,947
他可能要迟到 如果是这样 我们就应该等等他

412
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:55,933
这里的in which case就是由短语in this case变过来的

413
00:32:55,934 --> 00:33:00,347
这里which指前面整个句子“he may be late”

414
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:02,774
定语从句的倒装结构

415
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:08,414
具体的结构就是“介词+关系代词+从句谓语+从句主语”

416
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:13,321
即一个将整个谓语放在主语前面的全部倒装结构

417
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:19,148
This is the world out of which grows the hope for the first time in history

418
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:25,735
of a society where there will be freedom from want and freedom from fear.

419
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:29,629
第一个定语从句out of which grows the hope

420
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:34,935
for the first time in history of a society修饰world

421
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:39,362
在这个定语从句里有一个倒装结构和分隔结构

422
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:47,309
分隔结构是在the hope和of a society中间插入了短语for the first time in history

423
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:50,376
也就是说 如果没有这个插入语

424
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:55,390
就是the hope of a society 表示“希望建立这样一个社会”

425
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,563
整个短语the hope for the first time in history

426
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:08,950
of a society就表示“在人类历史上 首次希望建立这样一个社会” 这个名词短语是作定语从句的主语

427
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:19,004
定语从句的谓语是grows out of which在定语从句中作状语 所以整个定语从句是一个全部倒装结构

428
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:28,751
正常语序应该是：the hope for the first time in history of a society grows out of which （out of the world）

429
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:37,178
第二个定语从句where there will be freedom from want and freedom from fear修饰society

430
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:39,485
说明是什么样的社会

431
00:34:39,486 --> 00:34:46,032
难点是如何翻译freedom from want and freedom from fear这个短语

432
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:52,153
这里freedom from来自于形容词短语free from 表示“免除 没有”

433
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:55,179
另外 名词want表示“贫困”

434
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:00,140
因此 整个短语我们可以译成“摆脱贫困 摆脱恐惧”

435
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:06,726
The intellectual process I learned in that class is also life's process

436
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:15,260
because every life is a great work with all the richness of its gifts and the wealth of its possibilities.

437
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,047
When you graduate from here

438
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:28,713
you exit with thousands of pages of personal text on which are inscribed beliefs and values shaped by years of education

439
00:35:28,713 --> 00:35:30,980
family interactions

440
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:34,487
relationships experiences.

441
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:41,327
And buried within those thousands of pages is your personal truth your essence.

442
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:48,594
这段话来自惠普公司总裁在斯坦福大学的一次毕业典礼上对毕业生们的演讲

443
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:55,621
定语从句on which are inscribed beliefs and values shaped by years of education

444
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:59,261
family interactions relationships

445
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:05,488
experiences修饰名词短语thousands of pages of personal text

446
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:10,168
该从句的主语是beliefs and values shaped by years of

447
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:18,355
education family interactions relationships experiences 谓语是are inscribed

448
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:20,862
on which作地点状语

449
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:29,649
所以 整个定语从句是一个全部倒装结构 正常语序是：beliefs and values shaped by years of

450
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:41,436
education family interactions relationships experiences are inscribed on which （on thousands of pages of personal text）

451
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:46,383
我在那门课中所学的掌握知识的过程 也是生活的过程

452
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:53,370
因为每种人生都是一部伟大的著作 其中包含丰富的才智和美好的可能

453
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:58,904
当你从这里毕业时 你会带着数千页的人生教科书走出校门

454
00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:08,558
在这本教科书里铭刻着经过多年教育、家庭的作用、社会关系以及个人经历所形成的信念和价值观

455
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,425
而真实的你和你的精华就深藏在这数千页记录中

456
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:16,892
“介词+关系代词+ to do”结构

457
00:37:16,892 --> 00:37:19,985
例句1） The farmer used wood to

458
00:37:19,986 --> 00:37:23,546
build a house in which he could store grains.

459
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:29,652
例句2） The farmer used wood to build a house in which to store grains.

460
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:32,226
由1）句简化为2）句

461
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:40,999
先是把定语从句in which he could store grains中的主语he省去（因为he与主句主语the farmer一致

462
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:42,772
所以可以省略）

463
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:52,693
然后把情态动词could替换为不定式to（因为不定式具有情态意义） 于是便得到in which to store grains

464
00:37:52,693 --> 00:37:58,106
这位农夫用一些木材建造了一座房子 在那里储存粮食

465
00:37:58,107 --> 00:38:06,960
还可以进一步简化上面的例句2） 就是把关系词which去掉 此时就必须把介词in移到句末去

466
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:12,601
例句3） The farmer used wood to build a house to store grains in.

467
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:14,361
- 在例句1）中

468
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:21,067
是一个定语从句（in which he could store grains）作后置定语 修饰house

469
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:22,761
- 在例句2）中

470
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:29,721
则是一个“半定语从句半不定式”的混合形式（in which to store grains）作后置定语

471
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:31,387
修饰house

472
00:38:31,388 --> 00:38:38,788
- 在例句3）中 则是一个不定式（to store grains in）作后置定语 修饰house

473
00:38:38,788 --> 00:38:42,401
在使用这一结构时应注意以下几点：

474
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:46,628
“介词+关系代词”不能用一个关系副词来替换

475
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:52,774
比如不能说“The farmer used wood to build a house where to store grains.”

476
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:57,148
有介词、有关系代词时 不能将介词置于句末

477
00:38:57,148 --> 00:39:03,321
比如不能说“The farmer used wood to build a house which to store grains in. ”

478
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:09,748
若没有介词 我们不能采用“半定语从句半不定式”的混合形式作后置定语

479
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:15,029
比如不能说“I can't think of anybody whom to invite.”

480
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:19,255
而要说“I can't think of anybody to invite.

481
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:26,376
或者“I can't think of anybody who I should invite.”
