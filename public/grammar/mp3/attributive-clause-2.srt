00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
英语语法之-定语从句第二部分

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,760
关系代词as

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,706
as引导非限定性定语从句

4
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:14,413
as引导的非限定性定语从句的特点主要有两个：

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:19,134
1、as所指代的先行词通常都是一个完整的句子

6
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:22,934
2、as引导的定语从句位置很灵活

7
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,534
可以在句首、句中或句末

8
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:29,934
as引导的非限定性定语从句可以放在句首

9
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:33,027
此时as指代后面的整个主句

10
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:34,428
换句话说

11
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:38,601
关系代词as的先行词可以出现在as后边

12
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:42,175
这点不同于which及任何其他关系词

13
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:48,229
因为which及其他关系词所指代的先行词必须出现在它们的前面

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,083
因此which引导的非限定性定语从句不能放在句首

15
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:55,937
As is so often pointed out

16
00:00:55,938 --> 00:01:02,271
knowledge is a two-edged 武器 which can be used equally for good or evil.

17
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:06,338
这是一个放在句首的由as引导的定语从句

18
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:11,192
此时as所指代的先行词是其后面的完整的主句

19
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:18,193
即knowledge is a two-edged 武器 which can be used equally for good or evil

20
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:20,886
as在定语从句中作主语

21
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:26,180
注意：在这里我们不能说“Which is so often pointed out ...”

22
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:29,221
1） 什么什么 is known to us all

23
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,501
the whale is not fish but a mammal.

24
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:38,701
2） 什么什么 is known to us all that the whale is not fish but a mammal.

25
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:45,367
3） 什么什么 is known to us all is that the whale is not fish but a mammal.

26
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:46,514
我们知道

27
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,941
鲸不是鱼类

28
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,728
而是哺乳类动物

29
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,542
在例句1）中

30
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:54,009
两个分句间有逗号分隔

31
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,276
表明这是一个放在句首的非限定性定语从句

32
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,143
此时只能用as

33
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:01,957
在例句2）中

34
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,851
两个分句间多了一个连词that

35
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:07,438
替换了例句1）中的逗号

36
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,812
表明这是一个主语从句

37
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:14,306
其基本的结构是“It is+过去分词+that”

38
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:18,467
例句3）与例句2）相比多了一个谓语is

39
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:21,467
表明is前面的成分是主语

40
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:23,547
后面的成分是表语

41
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:28,347
在主语部分is known to us all里又有一个谓语is

42
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:32,347
这就表明充当主语的应该是一个主语从句

43
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:37,507
而且空白处填入的连词必须又能在主语从句中作主语

44
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:39,333
所以只能填What

45
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:43,467
as引导的非限定性定语从句可放在句中

46
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:44,868
放在句中

47
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:47,894
往往会分隔主句中的某两个成分

48
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:52,335
因此在分析句子时要跳过这个as引导的从句

49
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:56,268
直接将从句的前后两个成分联系起来看

50
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:58,135
这样才便于理解

51
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,229
尽管as引导的从句放在句中

52
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,776
但as所指代的先行词依然是主句

53
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:10,577
只不过此时的主句是被as引导的从句分隔成了前后两部分

54
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:15,243
which引导的非限定性定语从句也可以放在句中

55
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:18,817
但which的先行词必须出现在其前面

56
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:21,058
Stratford-on-Avon

57
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,938
as we all know

58
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:32,671
has only one industry—William Shakespeare—but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches.

59
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:34,125
众所周知

60
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:38,072
埃文河上的斯特拉特福德镇只有一个产业

61
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:40,019
即威廉·莎士比亚

62
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,420
但是存在着两个明显不同且日益敌对的分支

63
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,273
as引导的定语从句放在句中

64
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:51,434
隔开了主语Stratford-on- Avon与其谓语has

65
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:55,020
此时as指代的先行词依然是主句

66
00:03:55,021 --> 00:04:12,181
只不过此时的主句是被as引导的从句分隔成了Stratford-on-Avon和has only one industry— William Shakespeare—but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches
两部分

67
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:17,114
as指代这个主句的同时在定语从句中作know的宾语

68
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,568
这里若用which替换as

69
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,889
说成which we all know

70
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:27,555
那么which只能指代Stratford-on-Avon而不能指代整个主句

71
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:33,702
因此 which表示“我们所知道”的是Stratford-on-Avon这个城市

72
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:34,929
There is

73
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,210
as has been suggested

74
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,676
a growing body of research literature in journalism and broadcasting

75
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:50,263
but very little significant attention has been devoted to the study of the interview itself.

76
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:52,437
正如前面已经提及的

77
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:55,931
对新闻与广播的研究文献越来越多

78
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:59,825
但是却很少有关注新闻采访本身的研究

79
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:03,599
此时as所指代的先行词依然是主句

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:14,906
只不过此时的主句被as引导的从句分隔成了There is和a growing body of research literature in journalism and broadcasting

81
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:22,960
but very little significant attention has been devoted to the study of the interview itself两部分

82
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:25,454
这里不能用which代替as

83
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:29,455
因为定语从句前面只有there is这个结构

84
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,281
它不是一个名词

85
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:33,908
因而无法作which的先行词

86
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:38,069
as引导的非限定性定语从句可放在句末

87
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,975
which引导的非限定性定语从句也常常放在句末

88
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,749
在as引导的定语从句中

89
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,443
as有“正好……

90
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:48,444
“就像……

91
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:49,190
“由……

92
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:50,684
而知”的含义

93
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,858
当主句和从句在内容上一致时

94
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:57,992
或者说从句内容是顺着主句的意思说下来时

95
00:05:57,993 --> 00:05:59,499
通常用as

96
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,526
若主句和从句在内容上不一致

97
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:06,460
或从句的内容对主句的内容起消极作用

98
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:10,901
即对主句内容起反对、排斥、否定等作用时

99
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:12,541
则多用which

100
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,501
例句1） She has married again

101
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,607
as was expected.

102
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:19,101
她又结婚了

103
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:21,408
正如人们所预料的那样

104
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:24,449
例句2） She has married again

105
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,862
which was unexpected.

106
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:28,356
她又结婚了

107
00:06:28,357 --> 00:06:30,397
这真出乎人们预料

108
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,210
在例句1）中

109
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:40,184
定语从句中的关键词expected表明定语从句的意思与前面主句的意思是顺接关系

110
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:42,411
所以用as比较妥当

111
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:45,078
表示“正如人们所意料的那样”

112
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,892
在例句2）中

113
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:56,039
定语从句中的关键词unexpected表明定语从句的意思与前面主句的意思是否定、排斥的关系

114
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,373
所以用which比较妥当

115
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:00,840
表示“这是出乎人们意料的”

116
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,147
She is very careful

117
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:05,068
as her work shows.

118
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:06,494
她很细心

119
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,415
这从她的工作中就可看得出来

120
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,868
在该句中

121
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:15,455
定语从句的意思与前面主句的意思是顺接关系

122
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:17,682
所以用as比较妥当

123
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:20,443
表示“正如她的工作所显示的”

124
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:24,149
The young man cheated his friend of much money

125
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,616
which was disgraceful.

126
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:29,737
这个年轻人骗了他朋友很多钱

127
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,137
这真可耻

128
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:32,590
在该句中

129
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:41,604
定语从句中的关键词disgraceful表明定语从句的意思与前面主句的意思是否定、排斥的关系

130
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:43,938
所以用which比较妥当

131
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,725
表示“这真可耻”

132
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:48,446
as引导限定性定语从句

133
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:53,459
as引导限定性定语从句只能用在一些固定结构中

134
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,500
即只能用在由such

135
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,700
the same

136
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,206
as修饰的先行词的后面

137
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:03,500
as在定语从句中可以作主语、宾语或表语

138
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,994
as的先行词可以是人

139
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:07,368
也可以是物

140
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:10,009
as在定语从句中作主语

141
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,595
He ll repeat such points as are discussed in the book.

142
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:18,129
他将会重复书上讨论过的要点内容

143
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,330
这里such...as构成结构上的呼应关系

144
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,023
如果没有such

145
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:26,784
则不用as引导定语从句

146
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:31,850
比如可以说成“He ll repeat the points that are discussed in the book.”

147
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:36,651
He is not such a man as would leave his work half done.

148
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:41,717
也可以说成“He is not a man who would leave his work half done.”

149
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:45,211
他不是那种会将工作半途而废的人

150
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:55,505
The new map of the ocean floor shows the locations of twice as any undersea volcanoes as were previously thought to exist.

151
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:59,626
这里as...as构成结构上的呼应关系

152
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,146
如果没有as

153
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:03,692
则不用as引导定语从句

154
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:07,413
as的先行词是undersea volcanoes

155
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,213
新的洋底地图显示出海底火山的位置

156
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:14,439
火山数量是人们以前知道的两倍

157
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,133
as在定语从句中作宾语

158
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:21,654
He tried to make as few mistakes as he could avoid.

159
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:23,747
他尽量避免犯错误

160
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:25,921
如果没有前面的as

161
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:29,175
则不用后面的as引导定语从句

162
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:31,976
as指代先行词mistakes

163
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:35,002
并且在从句中作avoid的宾语

164
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:38,589
He is not the same playboy as we knew.

165
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,976
他不再是我们所知道的那个花花公子了

166
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:46,417
这里the same...as构成结构上的呼应关系

167
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:49,003
as在定语从句中作表语

168
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:53,364
He is not such a fool as we would assume him to be.

169
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:56,004
他并不像我们想象的那样傻

170
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:58,604
as指代先行词fool

171
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:01,270
并且在从句中作be的表语

172
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:03,004
关系代词than

173
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:06,511
than可作关系代词引导定语从句

174
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:09,832
在从句中一般作主语（也可作宾语）

175
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:13,832
than前面的主句需有形容词的比较级形式

176
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:17,152
比较级所修饰的名词即为先行词

177
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:18,605
than作主语

178
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:22,499
Don't drink more wine than is good for health.

179
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,126
不要过量饮酒

180
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,393
适量饮酒有益于健康

181
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:29,514
Don't give him more money than is needed

182
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:32,820
since money will burn a hole in his pocket.

183
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:34,407
不要多给他钱

184
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:36,648
他需要多少就给多少

185
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,754
因为他有钱就花光

186
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,248
than作宾语

187
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:48,622
He soon found it easy to make more money by thieving than his father had done by a lifetime of honest work.

188
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:52,689
这里的more所修饰的名词money即为先行词

189
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,916
than指代money的同时

190
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:59,930
在从句中作谓语动词had done（即had made）的宾语

191
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,677
很快他就发现

192
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:07,531
通过盗窃所得的钱比他老爸一辈子辛勤劳动挣来的钱要多得多

193
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:09,305
关系代词but

194
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:12,799
对于but用作关系代词的用法特点：

195
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,440
具有否定意义

196
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,613
相当于that...not

197
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:21,147
因此but后面接的定语从句在形式上是肯定的

198
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,228
但在意义上是否定的

199
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:27,894
but所修饰的先行词往往会被一个否定词修饰

200
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,295
换句话说

201
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:32,521
but常与具有否定意义的主句连用

202
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:38,602
主句中的否定和but本身的否定意义结合起来即构成双重否定

203
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:40,388
表达肯定意思

204
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:42,629
but可指人也可指物

205
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:44,869
在句中作主语或宾语

206
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:48,149
but通常只引导限定性定语从句

207
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,589
There is no man but errs.

208
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:52,002
人必犯错

209
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:56,136
该句相当于说“There is no man who doesn't err.”

210
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:58,817
表示“不犯错误的人是没有的”

211
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:01,217
关系代词but指代人

212
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:03,403
在定语从句中作主语

213
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:07,697
与此句相关的还有一句是“To err is human

216
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,525
表示“犯错人皆难免

217
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:14,472
宽恕则属超凡”

218
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:17,153
这两句话可以连在一起使用

219
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,219
There are very few but admire his talents.

220
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,980
很少有人不赞赏他的才干的

221
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,873
该句相当于说“There are very few who don't admire his talents.”

222
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,287
表示“不赞赏他的才能的人几乎没有”

223
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:36,741
关系代词but指代先行词few

224
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:38,928
在定语从句中作主语

225
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,262
缩合关系代词what

226
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:46,929
what的用法与其他关系代词在结构上有一个重大的区别

227
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,836
那就是what不能指代先行词

228
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:52,557
即what前面不能有名词

229
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:53,957
换句话说

230
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:58,850
what引导的从句并不能修饰主句中的任何先行词

231
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:08,304
All is a continuous supply of the basic necessities of life.

232
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:10,398
A. what is needed

233
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,532
B. the things needed

234
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,679
C. for our needs

235
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,773
D. that is needed

236
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:18,414
正确答案D

237
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:21,174
题干给出的是一个主句结构

238
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:24,614
其中all要被一个定语从句修饰

239
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:26,654
即all是先行词

240
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:28,600
所以不能选择A

241
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:32,401
因为不能用what来指代主句中的任何词

242
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:34,947
关系代词that指代all

243
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,761
在从句中作主语

244
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:38,775
此外 若选B

245
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,096
则主语是复数things

246
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:43,602
与后面的谓语is不搭配

247
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,096
也不能选C

248
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:49,390
因为没有all for our needs is...这样的句子结构

249
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:53,737
所需要的就是日常生活必需品能够持续供应

250
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:58,191
what在从句中大多数情况下是没有疑问意义的

251
00:13:58,192 --> 00:13:59,925
即不翻译成“什么”

252
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,246
而是理解为the things that

253
00:14:02,246 --> 00:14:04,832
all that或something that

254
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,513
可以把what看作是一个特殊的关系代词

255
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,766
它是先行词和关系代词的结合体

256
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,793
这就是为什么what被称为“缩合关系代词”

257
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:20,940
或者说what本身的含义里已经含有一个“隐性”的先行词了

258
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:25,914
这也就解释了为什么what前面不能再有“显性”的先行词

259
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:28,421
使用关系词what的前提：

260
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:31,235
what的前面不能有先行词

261
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:33,876
下面这个句子语法是错误的：

262
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:37,009
You can have everything what you like.

263
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,116
比较下面两个例句：

264
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:45,823
1） Dolphins might be trained to cooperate with fishermen and help them by finding

265
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:46,984
tracking

266
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,090
herding

267
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:54,424
or even catching fish—in all of which activities dolphins are expert.

268
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:57,585
海豚可能被训练成与渔民合作

269
00:14:57,585 --> 00:15:00,358
帮助他们寻找、跟踪、放牧

270
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,625
甚至捕鱼

271
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:04,212
海豚都是这些活动的专家

272
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:10,853
2） Dolphins might be trained to cooperate with fishermen and help them by finding

273
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:12,013
tracking

274
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:13,119
herding

275
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,600
or even catching fish—in all of what activities dolphins are expert.

276
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,480
(例句2是错误的)

277
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,293
在例句1）中

278
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:27,694
关系词which后面接了一个名词activities

279
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:33,000
整个短语which activities显然指的是前面提到的finding

280
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:34,161
tracking

281
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,267
herding

282
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,668
or even catching fish这一系列“活动”

283
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:43,694
这些动名词短语就是被关系词which所指代的先行词

284
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:46,615
因为在主句中有了这个先行词

285
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:49,601
所以就不能用what引导从句了

286
00:15:49,602 --> 00:15:54,535
大象吃的所有食物中的大部分是通过象鼻送到嘴里的

287
00:15:54,536 --> 00:16:01,402
1） Most of the food 什么什么 elephants eat is brought to their mouths by their trunks.

288
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:08,056
2） Most of 什么什么 food elephants eat is brought to their mouths by their trunks.

289
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:09,657
A. what B.

290
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:11,737
which C. who D.

291
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,577
as

292
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:14,390
在例句1）中

293
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,937
空格前面有一个名词food

294
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:20,191
即需要被定语从句修饰的先行词

295
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:23,112
而有了先行词就不能填入what

296
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,858
所以A不正确

297
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,579
因为food是指物不是指人

298
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,392
所以不能用who

299
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:31,753
又因为as要与the same

300
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:34,219
such或as搭配使用

301
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,260
所以也不能填as

302
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,726
故B正确

303
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:39,540
在例句2）中

304
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,034
空格前面没有任何名词

305
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,821
即没有先行词

306
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:45,808
所以要填入what

307
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:47,209
故A正确

308
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:51,929
贝多芬这位伟大的音乐家一生中创作了九部交响曲

309
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,315
其中大部分是在他耳朵失聪后完成的

310
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:56,676
Beethoven

311
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,622
the great musician

312
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,623
wrote A nine symphonies in his life

313
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:06,929
most of what B were written after he had lost C his hearing D .

314
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,490
B 应改为：

315
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,210
most of which

316
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,023
从表面上看来

317
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:16,384
这里的most of what中的what前面没有名词

318
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:20,024
但其实这是一个非限定性定语从句

319
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:24,837
这个定语从句是补充说明先行词nine symphonies的

320
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:26,558
因为有先行词

321
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,251
所以不能用what引导从句

322
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:31,572
而应改成most of which

323
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:34,758
也就相当于most of the nine symphonies

324
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,612
what单独使用

325
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:39,053
即其后面可以不接名词

326
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:40,866
what可表示物

327
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,360
也可表示人

328
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:48,334
所以 what在意义上相当于说the thing that 或the person that

329
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:52,108
此时的what一般不具有“什么”这样的疑问意义

330
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,029
她不再是以前的她了

331
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:57,055
She is not what she used to be.

332
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:00,096
这里的what后面没有接名词

333
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:01,816
what用来指人

334
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:05,536
原句可以改成一个含有定语从句的句子：

335
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:09,016
“She is not the girl that she used to be.

336
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,389
这里的what没有疑问意义

337
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,336
它相当于一个先行词和关系代词的结合体

338
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,417
从这个意义上来说

339
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:20,283
what引导的是一个定语从句

340
00:18:20,284 --> 00:18:22,284
但从结构上来说

341
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:26,137
这里what引导的从句是充当is的表语

342
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,804
即名词从句中的表语从句

343
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:31,258
可以称之为"What从句"

344
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:33,805
Show me what you have written.

345
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:37,219
可以改成一个含有定语从句的句子：

346
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,353
“Show me the things that you have written.

347
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:42,434
从这个意义上来说

348
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:45,300
what引导的是一个定语从句

349
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:47,301
但从结构上来说

350
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:51,234
这里的what从句是充当show的直接宾语

351
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:53,968
即名词从句中的宾语从句

352
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:59,582
今天的船只可以利用50年前还没有的卫星和声呐发现猎物

353
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:03,556
这意味着海洋里更大比例的鱼类正在被捕捉

354
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:09,157
Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar

355
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:12,930
which were not available 50 years ago.

356
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:18,463
That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught.

357
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:22,184
原句可以改成一个含有定语从句的句子：

358
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:28,064
“That means a higher proportion of the fish that is in the sea is being caught.

359
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,717
还要注意断句

360
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:33,931
不能理解成a higher proportion of what是主语

361
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,158
谓语是is in the sea

362
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:43,799
而应该理解成是a higher proportion of这个短语后面接了一个从句what is in the sea

363
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,772
即充当介词of的宾语的不是what这个词

364
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:51,053
而是what从句what is in the sea

365
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:55,999
所以 这个短语不是表示“更大比例的鱼类在海洋里”

366
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,400
而是要理解成“海洋里更大比例的鱼类”

367
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,973
what的后面可以接名词

368
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:05,094
尽管what的前面不能有名词

369
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:07,374
但它后面可以接名词

370
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,840
当what后面接名词时

371
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,147
what作关系形容词

372
00:20:12,148 --> 00:20:14,748
其结构是“what+名词”

373
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:18,054
相当于“all the+名词+that”

374
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:19,748
意思为“所有的……

375
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:21,242
尽可能多的……”

376
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:25,043
所以 此时的what同样没有疑问含义

377
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:27,549
这里的what一般表示物

378
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,976
而不表示人

379
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:33,910
大象吃的所有食物中的大部分是通过象鼻送到嘴里的

380
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:39,511
Most of what food elephants eat is brought to their mouths by their trunks.

381
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:42,244
这里what后面接名词food

382
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:45,631
what food相当于all the food that

383
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,378
表示“所有食物”

384
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,459
并不表示疑问意义的“什么食物”

385
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:57,752
于是 most of what food elephants eat相当于most of all the food that elephants eat

386
00:20:57,753 --> 00:21:01,339
表示“大象吃的所有食物中的大部分”

387
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:08,486
并不表示疑问意义的“大象吃的大部分是什么食物”或“大象大部分吃的是什么食物”

388
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:10,847
我身上所有的钱都给你了

389
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:14,207
What money I have has been given to you.

390
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:17,607
what money相当于all the money that

391
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,353
表示“所有的钱”

392
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:22,074
并不表示疑问意义的“什么钱”

393
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:27,314
于是 what money I have相当于all the money that I have

394
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:29,554
表示“我身上所有的钱”

395
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,967
并不表示疑问意义的“我身上有什么钱”

396
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:35,834
在“what+名词”这个结构中

397
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:40,395
在名词前面还可以添加其他限定词修饰名词

398
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:41,808
比如little

399
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,302
即“what little+名词”结构

400
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:49,436
相当于“all the little+名词+that”

401
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:51,650
表示“仅有的这点东西”

402
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:56,131
这次事故使他原本仅有的一点视力也完全丧失了

403
00:21:56,131 --> 00:22:01,597
The accident completely wiped out what little sight he had left.

404
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:06,798
名词短语little sight相当于说all the little sight that

405
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:08,931
表示“仅有的这点视力”

406
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:15,225
what little sight he had left相当于all the little sight that he had left

407
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:18,532
表示“他所剩下的仅有的这点视力”

408
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:21,119
what用在一些固定结构中

409
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,293
what从句常用在一些结构中

410
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:26,080
比如表示“所谓的”：

411
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:27,667
what is called

412
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,574
what can be called

413
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:31,228
what we call

414
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:33,242
what used to call

415
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:35,323
此外还有其他结构

416
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:38,243
比如：what they described as

417
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:40,429
what they regarded as

418
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,030
what you may see as等等

419
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,483
这些结构可以作插入语

420
00:22:45,484 --> 00:22:48,764
一般放在动词或介词后面作宾语

421
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:50,230
For Williams

422
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:55,697
those activities became what he calls “electronic heroin”.

423
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:57,431
对威廉斯来说

424
00:22:57,432 --> 00:23:01,072
这些活动成了他所称的“电子海X因”

425
00:23:01,072 --> 00:23:11,245
One difficulty is that almost all of what is called behavioral science continues to trace behavior to states of mind

426
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:12,432
feelings

427
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,539
traits of character

428
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,166
human nature

429
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,660
and so on.

430
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,301
难题之一在于

431
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:27,927
所谓的行为科学几乎全部依然从心态、感情、性格特征、人性等方面去寻求行为的根源

432
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,528
In America

433
00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:33,248
the move away from juggling to a simpler

434
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:38,541
less materialistic lifestyle is a well-established trend.

435
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:44,795
Downshifting—also known in America as “voluntary simplicity”—has

436
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:46,396
ironically

437
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:52,156
even bred a new area of what might be termed anticonsumerism.

438
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:58,729
在美国 从紧张忙碌的生活隐退到一种较为简单、不太注重物质的生活

439
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,916
这是一个明确的趋势

440
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,917
让人哭笑不得的是

441
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:09,077
放慢生活节奏——在美国也叫作“自愿返璞归
