1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
定语从句与同位语从句的区分

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,040
二者在结构上有相似性 都是“名词that从句” 这里的名词都称作先行词

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,586
从结构上区分：that是否作成分

4
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:21,186
that在定语从句中要充当成分 比如作从句的主语或宾语

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:26,907
而that在同位语从句中不充当任何成分 仅起连词的作用

6
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:38,053
换句话说 定语从句的结构是“名词+that+不完整的句子” 而同位语从句的结构是“名词that+完整的陈述句”

7
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:42,934
例句1）他到处散布的那个谣言 结果证明是假的

8
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:47,174
The rumor that he spread everywhere turned out to

9
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:48,734
be untrue.

10
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:53,640
例句2）有谣传说汤姆是小偷 结果证明是假的

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,440
The rumor that Tom was a thief turned out to be

12
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:58,534
untrue.

13
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:05,201
例句1）中的that在从句中充当spread的宾语 故此处为定语从句

14
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:10,027
例句2）中 的that在从句中不充当任何成分

15
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:15,814
因为从句“Tom was a thief”是一个完整的句子 不缺少任何成分

16
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:23,001
故其为同位语从句 作the rumor的同位语 补充说明the rumor的具体内容

17
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:26,588
例句1）我们讨论的这些情况很重要

18
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:31,095
The fact that we talked about is very important.

19
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:35,629
例句2）他的实验取得了成功 这让大家很高兴

20
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:41,402
The fact that he succeeded in the experiment pleased everybody.

21
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:47,322
例句1）中的that作talked about的宾语 故此处为定语从句

22
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:55,363
例句2）中的that不充当成分 因为“he succeeded in the experiment”是一个完整的陈述句

23
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:57,656
故其为同位语从句

24
00:01:57,657 --> 00:02:01,843
从意义上区分：that引导的从句的意义不同

25
00:02:01,843 --> 00:02:08,110
定语从句相当于形容词 对先行词起修饰、描述和限制的作用

26
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:15,857
同位语从句相当于一个名词 是对其前面名词内容的具体表述 二者是同位关系

27
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:19,577
1） The news that you heard is not true.

28
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:24,591
2） The news that Lincoln was murdered at a theater is true.

29
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:30,164
例句1）中的定语从句that you heard并不是表示news的内容

30
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:34,991
只是在限制news所指的范围 即“你听到的那个消息”

31
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:39,645
例句2）中的同位语从句that Lincoln was murdered at a

32
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:46,018
theater是表示news的具体 内容 在意义上与news构成同位关系

33
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:49,418
1）你听到的那个消息并不是真实的

34
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,619
2）有消息说林肯是在一个剧院被刺杀的 这是真的

35
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:58,379
例句1）你指出的这一点 我很感兴趣

36
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,805
The fact that you pointed out made me interested.

37
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:07,205
例句2）众所周知 月球上并没有生命存在

38
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:12,512
The fact that there are no lives on the moon is known to us all.

39
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,712
例句1）中的定语从句that you pointed out并不是表示fact的内容

40
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:23,633
只是在限制fact的所指范围 即“你指出的这个事实”

41
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:28,419
例句2）中的同位语从句that there are no lives on the

42
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,446
moon是表示fact的具体内容 在意义上与fact构成同位关系

43
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,020
带有插入语的定语从句

44
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:44,967
定语从句的关系词后面插入一个主谓结构 往往是一些表达个人主观观点的主谓结构

45
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:50,700
如they think he said they believe he claimed they assume等等

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,500
这些主谓结构紧跟在关系代词后面

47
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:59,381
作主语的关系词+插入语+定语从句的谓语部分

48
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:04,007
很多学生如果必须学一门他们认为很难的课程时

49
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:06,221
就会遇到很多问题

50
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:13,874
Many students face problems when they have to study a subject that they think is difficult.

51
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:23,328
这里的定语从句本身的结构是that...is difficult 但现在关系代词that后面紧跟了一个插入语they think

52
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:30,222
定语从句的主语that和谓语部分is difficult被they think这个插入语分隔

53
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:35,129
作宾语的关系词+插入语+定语从句的主谓部分

54
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:40,836
这个百万富翁有一个十分丑陋的女儿 可是让我难以想象的是

55
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:43,703
竟然有很多男孩子在追求她

56
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:51,463
The millionaire had a very ugly girl who I could not have dreamed many boys fell in love with.

57
00:04:51,464 --> 00:05:02,344
定语从句的宾语who和定语从句的主谓语many boys fell in love with被I could not have dreamed这个插入语
分隔

58
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:07,544
他们指出了这些损坏 认为这是由昨晚的暴风雪造成的

59
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:11,317
They pointed out the damage which they supposed

60
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:14,478
had been done by last night's storm.

61
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:20,038
这里的定语从句本身的结构应该是which...had been done by last

62
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:23,758
night's storm 修饰前面的名词damage

63
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:29,291
但现在关系代词which后面紧跟了一个插入语they supposed

64
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,358
我最近看过一本书

65
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:41,331
它是由一个英国人写的 我还记得书里有一句十分有趣的话 作者认为这句话说明了美国人为什么是这种性格

66
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:53,145
There was a very interesting remark in a book by an Englishman that I read recently giving what he thought was a reason for this American

67
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:55,159
characteristic.

68
00:05:55,159 --> 00:06:00,239
what引导的从句中带一个主谓结构的插入语he thought

69
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:04,572
Our limited thinking prevents us from progress.

70
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,039
There was a

71
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:15,346
fisherman who every time he caught a big fish would throw it back into the river keeping only the smaller ones.

72
00:06:15,346 --> 00:06:17,013
A man watching

73
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:22,987
this unusual behavior asked the fisherman why he was doing this.

74
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:28,120
The fisherman replied: “Because I have a small frying pan.

75
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:35,174
Most people never make it in life because they are carrying a small frying pan.

76
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:36,881
That is limited

77
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:38,187
thinking.

78
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:41,521
我们局限性的思维会阻碍我们进步

79
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:49,494
比如 有个渔夫 每次捕到大鱼时都会把它丢回河里 而只把个头比较小的鱼留下

80
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:54,575
有个人看到了渔夫这种不寻常的行为 就问他为什么这样做

81
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:58,855
渔夫回答说：“因为我家只有一只很小的平底锅

82
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:04,415
大部分人在生活中不能成功就是因为他们只带着一只小平底锅

83
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,695
这就是局限性的思维

84
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:17,508
并列定语从句 是指两个或两个以上的定语从句 通过and but or等并列连词连接共同修饰一个先行词

85
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:26,069
考试中所犯的错误 往往是因为某些知识点你不知道或者你认为自己知道（但实际上你不知道）

86
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:34,095
The errors occurring in the exam often result from the things that you don't know or that you think you know.

87
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:43,376
两个定语从句that you don't know 和that you think you know由连词or连接 修饰同一个先行词the things

88
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:47,122
这样的定语从句不是并列定语从句：

89
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:52,736
他在那件正要送到洗衣店去的西服里找到了他忘记的一美元

90
00:07:52,736 --> 00:08:00,082
He found a dollar bill that he had forgotten in a suit that he was sending to the cleaner.

91
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:08,856
两个定语从句that he had forgotten in a suit和that he was sending to the cleaner的先行词各不相同

92
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:13,897
前者的先行词是a dollar bill 后者的先行词是a suit

93
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:15,950
双层定语从句

94
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,470
He is the only person that we know who

95
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:22,897
speaks so many foreign languages.

96
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:31,977
第一层定语从句that we know的先行词为the only person 第二层定语从句who speaks so many foreign

97
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,631
languages的先行词为the only person that we know

98
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:43,364
他是我们所认识的人当中唯一一位会说这么多外语的人
